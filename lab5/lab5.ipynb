    "##  Word Sense Disambiguation: Recap\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be exploring the lexical sample task. This is a task where you use a corpus to learn how to disambiguate a small set of target words using supervised learning. The aim is to build a classifier that maps each occurrence of a target word in a corpus to its sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a Naive Bayes classifier. In other words, where the context of an occurrence of a target word in the corpus is represented as a feature vector, the classifier estimates the word sense s on the basis of its context as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt Text](nb_maths.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [senseval-2](http://www.hipposmond.com/senseval2) corpus for our training and test data. This corpus consists of text from a mixture of places, including the British National Corpus and the Penn Treebank portion of the Wall Street Journal. Each word in the corpus is tagged with its part of speech, and the senses of the following target words are also manually annotated: the nouns interest, line; the verb serve and the adjective hard. You can find out more about the task from [here](http://www.hipposmond.com/senseval2/descriptions/english-lexsample.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of senses that are used to annotate each target word come from WordNet (more on that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started: Run the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Look at the code below, and try to understand how it works (don't worry if you don't understand some of it, it's not necessary for doing this task).\n",
    "    Rememmber, `help(...)` is your friend:\n",
    "  * `help([class name])` for classes and all their methods and instance variables\n",
    "  * `help([any object])` likewise\n",
    "  * `help([function])` or `help([class].[method])` for functions / methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This code allows you to do several things. You can now run, train and evaluate a range of Naive Bayes classifiers over the corpus to acquire a model of WSD for a given target word: the adjective hard, the nouns interest or line, and the verb serve. We'll learn later how you do this. First, we're going to explore the nature of the corpus itself. "
